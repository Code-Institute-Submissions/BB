# BellyBox - Django Project

An exercise in creating a Django blog that allows for users to register, login and create new blog posts. The posts are equipped with Disqus Comments to promote engagement, and provides edit functionality for uses when logged in and authenticated. The blog has upgraded Django security features to force HTTPS redirects.
